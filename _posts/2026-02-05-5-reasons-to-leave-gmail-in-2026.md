Gmail has been the world's most popular email service for nearly two decades. It's free, it's reliable, and it integrates seamlessly with the rest of Google's ecosystem. So why would anyone want to leave?

The answer comes down to one word: **privacy**.

## 1. Your Emails Are Being Scanned

While Google claims they stopped using email content for ad targeting in 2017, they never stopped scanning your emails entirely. Gmail uses automated systems to:

- Detect spam and malware
- Surface "smart replies" and suggestions
- Extract events for your calendar
- Identify package tracking numbers
- Parse receipts and purchases

Every one of these features requires reading your email content. The question isn't whether Google can read your emails—it's what they're doing with that information.

## 2. Your Data Feeds the Advertising Machine

Gmail is "free" because you pay with your personal data. Even if email content isn't directly used for ads, Google builds comprehensive profiles from:

- Who you email and how often
- What newsletters you subscribe to
- What companies send you receipts
- Your communication patterns and timing

This metadata is incredibly valuable for advertising, even without reading message content.

## 3. US Surveillance Laws Apply

Google is a US company, which means your data is subject to US surveillance laws including:

- The FISA Amendments Act
- National Security Letters (NSLs)
- The CLOUD Act

Google has received tens of thousands of government requests for user data and complies with most of them. If you're not a US citizen, you have essentially zero legal protection.

## 4. No True Encryption

Standard Gmail has no end-to-end encryption. Google holds the encryption keys, which means:

- Google can read your emails
- Google can be compelled to hand over your emails
- A Google breach could expose your messages

Even Gmail's "Confidential Mode" is marketing theater—Google still holds the keys.

## 5. Better Alternatives Exist

Services like Proton Mail offer what Gmail cannot:

- **True end-to-end encryption** by default
- **Zero-access architecture** where even Proton can't read your emails
- **Swiss privacy laws** that protect your data
- **No advertising** and no profiling
- **Open source code** that anyone can audit

## Making the Switch

Switching from Gmail to Proton Mail is easier than you might think:

1. Create a free Proton Mail account
2. Use Proton's Easy Switch to import your Gmail messages
3. Set up forwarding to catch emails during transition
4. Update your email address with important services
5. Enjoy true email privacy

The best time to leave Gmail was years ago. The second best time is today.
