## Why Switch from Gmail to Proton Mail?

Gmail is free because **you are the product**. Google scans your emails to build advertising profiles, tracks your activity across the web, and stores your most personal communications on servers subject to US surveillance laws.

Proton Mail offers a fundamentally different approach: **your emails are encrypted so that even Proton cannot read them**.

## Key Benefits of Proton Mail

### End-to-End Encryption
Every email you send to another Proton Mail user is automatically encrypted end-to-end. For external recipients, you can send password-protected emails that expire after a set time.

### Zero-Access Architecture
Unlike Gmail, Proton Mail uses zero-access encryption. Your emails are encrypted with your password before they reach Proton's servers. Even Proton employees cannot read your messages.

### Swiss Privacy Protection
Proton is headquartered in Switzerland and operates under Swiss privacy laws, which are among the strongest in the world. Your data is protected by Swiss neutrality and cannot be accessed by US authorities without Swiss court approval.

### No Ads, No Tracking
Proton Mail has no advertising and does not track your activity. Your inbox is completely private.

### Easy Migration from Gmail
Proton provides free tools to import your existing Gmail messages, contacts, and calendar events. The switch is seamless.
