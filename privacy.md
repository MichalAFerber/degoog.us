At DeGoog.us, we practice what we preach. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you visit our website.

## Our Privacy Philosophy

We believe privacy is a fundamental right, not a luxury. We've designed this website to collect as little data as possible while still providing a useful experience.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

If you contact us via email, we collect:
- Your email address
- The content of your message
- Any information you choose to include

### Automatically Collected Information

When you visit our website, our hosting provider (Cloudflare) may collect:
- IP address (anonymized)
- Browser type and version
- Device type
- Pages visited
- Referring website
- Date and time of visit

We do **not** use Google Analytics or any other third-party tracking services that build advertising profiles.

## How We Use Information

We use collected information to:
- Respond to your inquiries
- Improve our website content
- Ensure website security
- Analyze aggregate traffic patterns (no individual tracking)

We do **not**:
- Sell your personal information
- Share your data with advertisers
- Build advertising profiles
- Track you across other websites

## Cookies

This website uses minimal cookies:

- **Essential cookies**: Required for basic website functionality
- **Preference cookies**: Remember your settings (if any)

We do **not** use:
- Advertising cookies
- Third-party tracking cookies
- Social media tracking pixels

You can disable cookies in your browser settings without affecting your ability to use this website.

## Affiliate Links

When you click on affiliate links to Proton services, you will be redirected to Proton's website. At that point, Proton's privacy policy applies. We recommend reviewing their privacy policy at [proton.me/legal/privacy](https://proton.me/legal/privacy).

Our affiliate links may contain tracking parameters that help Proton attribute referrals to our website. This tracking is handled by Proton, not by us.

## Third-Party Services

### Cloudflare

Our website is hosted on Cloudflare Pages. Cloudflare may collect certain technical information as part of their content delivery and security services. See [Cloudflare's Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) for details.

### No Google Services

Ironically (or perhaps fittingly), we do not use any Google services on this website:
- No Google Analytics
- No Google Fonts (fonts are self-hosted)
- No Google Tag Manager
- No Google Ads
- No reCAPTCHA

## Data Retention

- **Contact form submissions**: Retained for as long as necessary to respond to your inquiry, then deleted
- **Server logs**: Automatically deleted by Cloudflare per their retention policies

## Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have the right to:
- Access the personal data we hold about you
- Request correction of inaccurate data
- Request deletion of your data
- Object to certain processing
- Data portability

To exercise these rights, contact us at {{ site.author.email }}.

## Children's Privacy

This website is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## International Transfers

If you access this website from outside the United States, your information may be transferred to and processed in the United States.
