## Our Mission

De-Google.US exists for one purpose: **to help you reclaim your digital privacy**.

We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right, not a feature you should have to pay extra for or sacrifice for convenience. The dominance of Google and other Big Tech companies has created a world where surveillance capitalism is the default, and true privacy requires conscious effort.

We're here to make that effort easier.

## Who We Are

De-Google.US is operated by **{{ site.author.company }}** (d.b.a. **{{ site.author.name }}**), a small digital privacy advocacy project based in {{ site.author.location }}.

We're not a large corporation or a well-funded startup. We're privacy advocates who believe that everyone deserves access to clear, honest information about protecting their digital lives.

## Why We Focus on Proton

After evaluating numerous privacy-focused service providers, we've chosen to focus on Proton for several reasons:

1. **Comprehensive ecosystem**: Proton offers replacements for most Google services in one integrated suite
2. **Swiss jurisdiction**: Strong privacy laws and no participation in surveillance alliances
3. **Open source**: All apps can be independently verified
4. **Proven track record**: Operating since 2014 with millions of users
5. **Accessible pricing**: Generous free tiers make privacy accessible to everyone

We are an independent **Proton Partner**, which means we may earn a commission when you sign up for Proton services through our links. This helps support our work, but it does not influence our editorial content. We only recommend products we genuinely believe in.

## Our Content Philosophy

### Honest Comparisons

We provide factual comparisons between Google services and privacy alternatives. We don't exaggerate Google's flaws or oversell Proton's benefits. We present the information and let you decide.

### No Fear-Mongering

Privacy is important, but we don't believe in scaring people into action. We focus on education and empowerment, not fear.

### Practical Advice

We know that going from Google to privacy-first services isn't always easy. Our guides are designed to be practical and achievable, even for non-technical users.

### Transparency

We're upfront about our affiliate relationships and our limitations. We're not security researchers or legal experts—we're privacy advocates sharing what we've learned.

## What We Don't Do

- **We don't collect your data**: We practice what we preach
- **We don't use Google services**: No Google Analytics, no Google Fonts, nothing
- **We don't accept sponsored content**: Our recommendations are our own
- **We don't make guarantees**: Privacy is a journey, not a destination

## Get Involved

The best way to support our mission is to:

1. **Share our content** with friends and family who might benefit
2. **Use our affiliate links** if you decide to try Proton services
3. **Send us feedback** about what content would be helpful
