## Why Switch from Chrome Passwords to Proton Pass?

Chrome's built-in password manager stores your passwords in Google's cloud, tied to your Google account. If your Google account is compromised, so are all your passwords. Most browsers store passwords with limited encryption, making them vulnerable to malware or local attacks.

Proton Pass uses **end-to-end encryption** so that only you can access your passwords — not even Proton. Unlike competitors, Proton Pass encrypts not just passwords but also metadata, email addresses, and URLs.

## Key Benefits

### True Zero-Access Encryption
All your passwords, secure notes, and login information are encrypted before leaving your device. Proton cannot see your credentials — your data is never visible to anyone but you, not even in encrypted form on the server.

### Open Source & Independently Audited
Proton Pass is completely open source and has been independently audited by security experts. All code is publicly available and regularly verified — you can verify the security yourself.

### Built-In 2FA Authenticator
Store two-factor authentication codes directly alongside your logins. No need for a separate authenticator app — everything is encrypted and synced across devices.

### Hide-My-Email Aliases
Manage multiple inboxes, combat spam, and protect your real email address with advanced email alias management — powered by Proton Mail integration.

### Custom Item Storage
Store diverse data types including passports, WiFi codes, SSH keys, and credit cards in custom encrypted formats — everything in one secure vault.

### Command-Line Interface
For power users, the Proton Pass CLI enables terminal-based access to your credentials for enhanced productivity and security in development workflows.

### Dark Web Monitoring
Proton monitors the dark web for your email addresses and alerts you if your credentials appear in a breach, so you can act immediately.

### Secure Password Sharing
Share passwords securely with family members or team members with end-to-end encryption — credentials are never exposed in plain text.
