## Why Choose Proton VPN?

Your internet service provider can see every website you visit. Advertisers track you across the web. In some countries, governments censor the internet entirely. A VPN is your first line of defense — but only if you can trust the provider.

Proton VPN is built from the ground up to protect your privacy, with a **strict no-logs policy that has been independently audited**. Based in Switzerland and created by the same scientists from CERN who built Proton Mail.

## Key Benefits

### Strict No-Logs Policy
Proton VPN keeps no logs of your activity. This has been verified by independent security audits. Even if compelled by authorities, Proton has nothing to hand over.

### Swiss Jurisdiction
Proton VPN operates under Swiss law, which provides strong privacy protections. Switzerland is not part of any surveillance alliances (Five Eyes, Nine Eyes, Fourteen Eyes).

### VPN Accelerator
Proprietary technology that increases VPN speeds by up to 400%. Enjoy smooth, buffer-free streaming and downloads even on distant servers.

### NetShield Ad-Blocker
Block malware, intrusive ads, and tracking scripts automatically while browsing. Makes your online experience faster, more private, and more secure.

### Secure Core & Stealth Protocol
Secure Core routes your traffic through multiple hardened servers for maximum protection. Stealth protocol disguises VPN traffic to bypass blocks in countries like China, Russia, and Iran.

### Free Tier — No Catches
Proton VPN's free tier has no data limits, no speed throttling on free servers, and absolutely no ads. A genuinely free VPN from a company you can trust.

### Browser Extensions
Chrome and Firefox extensions make it easy to protect your privacy and bypass censorship directly from your browser.
