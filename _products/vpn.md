## Why Choose Proton VPN Over Google One VPN?

Google One VPN is being discontinued in 2024, but even when it was available, it had a fundamental problem: **it was run by Google**, a company whose business model is based on collecting your data.

Proton VPN is built from the ground up to protect your privacy, with a strict no-logs policy that has been independently audited.

## Key Benefits of Proton VPN

### Strict No-Logs Policy
Proton VPN keeps no logs of your activity. This has been verified by independent security audits. Even if compelled by authorities, Proton has nothing to hand over.

### Swiss Jurisdiction
Proton VPN operates under Swiss law, which provides strong privacy protections. Switzerland is not part of any surveillance alliances.

### High-Speed Servers
With over 3,000 servers in 65+ countries, Proton VPN offers fast connections for streaming, gaming, and everyday browsing.

### Free Tier Available
Proton VPN offers a genuinely free tier with no data limits, no speed restrictions on free servers, and no ads.

### Open Source
All Proton VPN apps are open source, meaning security experts can verify the code. You don't have to trust—you can verify.

### Kill Switch & Always-On
Protect against data leaks with automatic kill switch and always-on VPN features.
