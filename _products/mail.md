## Why Switch from Gmail to Proton Mail?

Gmail is free because **you are the product**. Google scans your emails to build advertising profiles, tracks your activity across the web, and stores your most personal communications on servers subject to US surveillance laws like FISA.

Proton Mail is fundamentally different: **your emails are encrypted so that even Proton cannot read them**. It's funded by users, not advertisers, so your data stays yours.

Trusted by journalists, activists, and security professionals worldwide — including organizations like Reporters Without Borders — Proton Mail is the email service for people who take privacy seriously.

## Key Benefits

### Zero-Access Encryption
Your emails are encrypted with your password before they reach Proton's servers. Not even Proton employees can read your messages. For external recipients, you can send password-protected emails that automatically expire.

### Swiss Privacy Protection
Proton is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland and operates under Swiss privacy laws — among the strongest in the world. Your data is protected by Swiss neutrality and cannot be accessed by foreign governments without Swiss court approval.

### No Ads, No Tracking, No Profiling
Proton Mail has zero advertising and does not track your activity. Unlike Gmail, Proton doesn't scan your emails for ad targeting or use your data to build profiles.

### Brand New Mobile Apps
Rebuilt from the ground up in 2025, the new mobile apps feature offline mode, improved performance, and a modern design on both iOS and Android.

### Proton Scribe — Private AI Writing Assistant
Write and proofread emails with a private AI that runs without exposing your business data to external services like ChatGPT or Google's AI.

### Dark Web Monitoring
Proton monitors the dark web for data breaches affecting your accounts and alerts you immediately so you can change compromised passwords.

### Easy Migration from Gmail
Proton's Easy Switch tool imports your existing Gmail messages, contacts, and calendar events automatically. You can even forward emails from Gmail during the switch.
