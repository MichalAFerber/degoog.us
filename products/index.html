## Why Choose Proton?

Proton was founded in 2014 by scientists who met at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. They created Proton Mail to give everyone access to the same level of security that was previously only available to intelligence agencies.

Today, Proton offers a complete suite of privacy-focused services that can replace virtually every Google service you use:

- **Proton Mail** replaces Gmail with end-to-end encrypted email
- **Proton Drive** replaces Google Drive with encrypted cloud storage
- **Proton VPN** provides truly private internet access
- **Proton Calendar** replaces Google Calendar with encrypted scheduling
- **Proton Pass** replaces Chrome's password manager with secure credential storage

### Swiss Privacy

All Proton services are based in Switzerland and protected by Swiss privacy laws. Unlike US-based companies, Proton cannot be compelled to hand over your data to foreign governments.

### Open Source

Every Proton app is open source, meaning anyone can inspect the code to verify its security. This transparency is essential for trust.

### Zero-Access Encryption

Proton uses zero-access encryption, which means they cannot read your data even if they wanted to. Your encryption keys never leave your devices.
