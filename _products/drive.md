## Why Switch from Google Drive to Proton Drive?

When you store files on Google Drive, Google can access them. They scan your documents, can share data with authorities, and may use your files to train AI models. Your most sensitive documents deserve better protection.

Proton Drive encrypts your files **before they leave your device**, meaning only you can access them — not even Proton.

## Key Benefits

### Client-Side Encryption
All files are encrypted on your device before upload. The encryption keys never leave your control, so Proton cannot access your files even if they wanted to. File names, folder names, and all metadata are encrypted too.

### Swiss Data Protection
Your encrypted files are stored in Switzerland under some of the world's strongest privacy laws. No mass surveillance, no data sharing with foreign governments.

### Proton Docs & Sheets
Create and collaborate on documents and spreadsheets with end-to-end encryption. Proton Docs and the new Proton Sheets (launched 2025) let you work together without exposing your data.

### Photo Backup & Albums
Back up photos from your mobile device with automatic encryption. Organize with albums, migrate from Google Photos on Windows, and import local folders — all protected by E2E encryption.

### Secure File Sharing
Share files and folders with encrypted links. Set passwords and expiration dates for shared links to maintain control over who accesses your data.

### Desktop & Mobile Sync
Folder synchronization on macOS and Windows keeps your files in sync across all devices. The "Optimize Storage" feature manages disk space automatically.
