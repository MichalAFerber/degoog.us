## The Mission

De-Google.US exists for one purpose: **to help you take back ownership of your data**.

Privacy is a fundamental right, not a premium feature. The dominance of Google and Big Tech has created a world where surveillance capitalism is the default—where your emails, searches, location, and calendar are mined for profit without your meaningful consent.

This site provides the roadmap out.

## Who's Behind This

De-Google.US is a project of **{{ site.author.company }}**, operating as **{{ site.author.name }}**, based in {{ site.author.location }}.

This isn't a faceless startup or a content farm. Behind every guide on this site is **30 years of hands-on IT consulting experience**—designing enterprise networks, building secure infrastructure, and advising businesses on technology strategy. The migration architectures recommended here aren't theoretical. They're the same patterns deployed in real production environments for real clients.

When you follow a guide on De-Google.US, you're getting advice vetted by a seasoned professional who has built and maintained the kind of infrastructure being recommended.

## Why We Focus on Proton

After evaluating numerous privacy-focused service providers, Proton stands out for several reasons:

1. **Comprehensive ecosystem**: Replacements for most Google services in one integrated suite
2. **Swiss jurisdiction**: Strong privacy laws, no participation in surveillance alliances
3. **Open source**: Every app can be independently verified
4. **Proven track record**: Operating since 2014 with over 100 million users
5. **Accessible pricing**: Generous free tiers make privacy accessible to everyone

We are an independent **Proton Partner**, which means we may earn a commission when you sign up through our links. This supports the project but does not influence our editorial content. We only recommend tools we would use ourselves.

## Our Content Philosophy

### Honest Comparisons

We provide factual comparisons between Google services and privacy alternatives. No exaggeration, no fearmongering. We present the facts and let you decide.

### Practical, Expert-Vetted Advice

Our guides are built for real-world migration. Step-by-step, with the kind of detail that comes from actually doing this work for decades—not just writing about it.

### Transparency

We're upfront about our affiliate relationships. We don't accept sponsored content. Our recommendations are our own.

## What This Site Doesn't Do

- **Collect your data**: We practice what we preach—zero trackers, zero analytics, zero Google fonts
- **Use Google services**: Nothing from Google touches this site
- **Accept sponsored content**: Every recommendation is independent
- **Make guarantees**: Privacy is a journey, and we're honest about the tradeoffs

## Get Involved

The best way to support the mission:

1. **Share these guides** with friends and family who need them
2. **Use our partner links** if you decide to try Proton services
3. **Send us feedback** on what guides would be most useful
