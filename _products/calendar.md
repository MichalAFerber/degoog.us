## Why Switch from Google Calendar to Proton Calendar?

Your calendar reveals intimate details about your life: doctor appointments, therapy sessions, job interviews, who you meet, and where you go. Google Calendar stores all of this unencrypted and uses it to build your advertising profile.

Proton Calendar encrypts all your events so that **only you can see your schedule**.

## Key Benefits of Proton Calendar

### Encrypted Events
All event details—titles, descriptions, locations, and attendees—are encrypted. Proton cannot see when you have a doctor's appointment or who you're meeting for lunch.

### Privacy-Respecting Invitations
Send event invitations without exposing your entire schedule. Recipients see only the events you explicitly share.

### Seamless Proton Integration
Proton Calendar integrates perfectly with Proton Mail. Event invitations are automatically added to your calendar, all with end-to-end encryption.

### Import from Google Calendar
Easily import your existing Google Calendar events during the switch.

### Multiple Calendars
Create separate calendars for work, personal, and other areas of your life, all encrypted.
