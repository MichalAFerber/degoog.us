## Why Switch from Google Drive to Proton Drive?

When you store files on Google Drive, Google can access them. They scan your documents, can share data with authorities, and may use your files to train AI models. Your most sensitive documents deserve better protection.

Proton Drive encrypts your files **before they leave your device**, meaning only you can access them.

## Key Benefits of Proton Drive

### Client-Side Encryption
All files are encrypted on your device before upload. The encryption keys never leave your control, so Proton cannot access your files even if they wanted to.

### Zero-Knowledge Storage
Proton has zero knowledge of what you store. File names, folder names, and file contents are all encrypted with keys that only you hold.

### Swiss Data Protection
Your encrypted files are stored in Switzerland under some of the world's strongest privacy laws. No mass surveillance, no data sharing with foreign governments.

### Secure File Sharing
Share files and folders with end-to-end encryption. Set passwords and expiration dates for shared links.

### Automatic Photo Backup
Back up photos from your mobile device with automatic encryption. Your memories stay private.
