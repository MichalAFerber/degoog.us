## Why Switch from Google Calendar to Proton Calendar?

Your calendar reveals intimate details about your life: doctor appointments, therapy sessions, job interviews, who you meet, and where you go. Google Calendar stores all of this unencrypted and uses it to build your advertising profile.

Proton Calendar encrypts all your events so that **only you can see your schedule** — not Google, not advertisers, not even Proton.

## Key Benefits

### Encrypted Events
All event details — titles, descriptions, locations, and attendees — are encrypted with keys that only you hold. Your schedule is genuinely private.

### Privacy-Respecting Invitations
Send event invitations without exposing your entire schedule. Recipients see only the events you explicitly share with them.

### Seamless Proton Mail Integration
Proton Calendar integrates perfectly with Proton Mail. Event invitations are automatically added to your calendar, all with end-to-end encryption. Available in the new desktop apps for Mac and Windows.

### Import from Google Calendar
Easily import your existing Google Calendar events during the switch. Export as ICS from Google, import with one click into Proton.

### Multiple Calendars
Create separate calendars for work, personal, and other areas of your life. All encrypted, all private.

### Cross-Platform
Available on web, iOS, and Android — with calendar integration in the native Proton Mail desktop apps.
