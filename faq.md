## General Questions

### What does "de-Google" mean?

De-Googling refers to the process of reducing or eliminating your dependence on Google services. This includes replacing Gmail with private email, Google Drive with encrypted storage, Chrome with privacy-respecting browsers, and more. The goal is to reclaim your digital privacy by moving away from services that monetize your personal data.

### Why should I care about privacy if I have nothing to hide?

The "nothing to hide" argument misunderstands privacy. Privacy isn't about hiding wrongdoing—it's about:

- **Autonomy**: Controlling who knows what about you
- **Security**: Reducing your attack surface for identity theft
- **Freedom**: Avoiding manipulation through targeted content
- **Principle**: Maintaining a fundamental human right

You close the bathroom door not because you're doing something wrong, but because some things are simply private.

### Is Google really that bad?

Google provides genuinely useful services, but their business model is built on collecting and monetizing your data. They:

- Scan your emails for advertising insights
- Track your location history
- Build detailed profiles for ad targeting
- Store your data on US servers subject to surveillance laws
- Have experienced data breaches and security incidents

Whether this is "bad" depends on your values, but it's important to understand the trade-off you're making.

### Can I really replace all Google services?

Yes, though it requires effort. Proton alone can replace:
- Gmail → Proton Mail
- Google Drive → Proton Drive
- Google Calendar → Proton Calendar
- Chrome passwords → Proton Pass

For other services (Search, YouTube, Maps), you'll need additional alternatives, but comprehensive de-Googling is absolutely achievable.

## About Proton

### Who is Proton?

Proton was founded in 2014 by scientists who met at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research). They created Proton Mail to give everyone access to the same level of encryption used by governments and security agencies. Today, Proton offers a full suite of privacy-focused services with over 100 million users.

### Why is Swiss jurisdiction important?

Switzerland offers uniquely strong privacy protections:

- **Not part of surveillance alliances**: Switzerland is not a member of the 5 Eyes, 9 Eyes, or 14 Eyes intelligence-sharing agreements
- **Constitutional privacy rights**: Privacy is protected by the Swiss constitution
- **No mass surveillance**: Unlike the US or UK, Switzerland has no mass surveillance programs
- **Strict data laws**: Foreign governments cannot directly access data; requests must go through Swiss courts

### Is Proton truly private? How can I verify?

Proton's privacy claims are verifiable:

1. **Open Source**: All Proton apps are open source. Anyone can review the code on GitHub
2. **Independent Audits**: Security firms like Securitum regularly audit Proton's systems
3. **Zero-Access Architecture**: Proton mathematically cannot read your data because you hold the encryption keys
4. **Transparency Reports**: Proton publishes reports showing government data requests (and how few they can fulfill)

### Does Proton have a free tier?

Yes! Proton offers generous free tiers:

- **Proton Mail Free**: 1 GB storage, 1 email address, 150 messages/day
- **Proton VPN Free**: Unlimited data, servers in 3 countries, 1 device
- **Proton Drive Free**: 1 GB encrypted storage
- **Proton Pass Free**: Unlimited passwords, 2 vaults

Premium plans add more storage, features, and support.

### What's the difference between Proton Mail and Proton Unlimited?

- **Proton Mail (paid)**: Enhanced email features only
- **Proton Unlimited**: Access to ALL Proton services (Mail, VPN, Drive, Calendar, Pass) with maximum storage and features

Proton Unlimited is the best value if you plan to use multiple services.

## Switching & Migration

### How hard is it to switch from Gmail to Proton Mail?

Easier than you might think:

1. Create a free Proton Mail account
2. Use Proton's "Easy Switch" tool to import Gmail messages, contacts, and calendar
3. Set up forwarding from Gmail to catch emails during transition
4. Update your email address with important services over time

Most people complete the switch in a few weeks to a few months.

### Will I lose my old emails if I switch?

No. Proton's Easy Switch tool imports your entire Gmail history. Your old emails will be available in Proton Mail, now protected by encryption.

### Can people still email me at my Gmail address?

Yes, during your transition. Set up forwarding from Gmail to Proton Mail, and you'll receive emails at both addresses. Over time, update your contacts and accounts to use your new Proton address.

### What about my Google Drive files?

You can download your Google Drive files and upload them to Proton Drive. For large libraries, this takes time but is straightforward. Your files will be encrypted before upload, so even Proton can't see them.

### Do I need to be technical to use Proton?

Not at all. Proton's apps are designed to be as user-friendly as Google's. The encryption happens automatically in the background—you just use email, storage, and VPN like normal.

## Security & Privacy

### What is end-to-end encryption?

End-to-end encryption (E2EE) means your data is encrypted on your device before being sent anywhere. Only you (and your intended recipients) can decrypt it. Even Proton's servers only see encrypted gibberish.

Compare this to Gmail, where Google holds the encryption keys and can read your emails.

### What is "zero-access" encryption?

Zero-access means the service provider (Proton) has zero access to your data. Your encryption keys are derived from your password and never leave your device. Proton stores only encrypted data they cannot decrypt.

### Can Proton be hacked?

Any service can potentially be compromised, but Proton's architecture minimizes damage from breaches:

- Servers store only encrypted data
- No plaintext passwords are stored
- Even if hackers access servers, they get encrypted gibberish
- Your password (which you know) is needed to decrypt anything

This is fundamentally more secure than services that store data they can read.

### What happens if I forget my Proton password?

Because Proton uses zero-access encryption, they cannot reset your password and recover your data. This is the trade-off for true privacy. However:

- You can set up a recovery phrase during setup
- You can add a recovery email
- Premium users have additional recovery options

Write down your recovery information and store it safely.

### Is Proton VPN as good as other VPNs?

Proton VPN is among the best:

- **No-logs policy**: Independently audited
- **Speed**: High-speed servers with 10 Gbps connections
- **Server network**: 3,000+ servers in 65+ countries
- **Features**: Kill switch, split tunneling, Secure Core
- **Price**: Free tier available; paid plans are competitively priced
