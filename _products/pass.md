## Why Switch from Chrome Passwords to Proton Pass?

Chrome's built-in password manager stores your passwords in Google's cloud, tied to your Google account. If your Google account is compromised, so are all your passwords. Plus, Google can access your login credentials.

Proton Pass uses **end-to-end encryption** so that only you can access your passwords—not even Proton.

## Key Benefits of Proton Pass

### End-to-End Encrypted
All your passwords, secure notes, and login information are encrypted before leaving your device. Proton cannot see your credentials.

### Open Source & Audited
Proton Pass is completely open source and has been independently audited by security experts. You can verify the security yourself.

### Built-In 2FA Authenticator
Proton Pass includes a built-in two-factor authentication (2FA) code generator, eliminating the need for a separate authenticator app.

### Secure Password Sharing
Share passwords securely with family members or team members without exposing them in plain text.

### Cross-Platform
Use Proton Pass on any device with apps for iOS, Android, and browser extensions for all major browsers.

### Dark Web Monitoring
Proton Pass monitors the dark web for your email addresses and alerts you if your credentials appear in a breach.
